# Rubar

My script for lemonbar, written in ruby.

~~Not guaranteed to work on all Linux systems.~~
Trying to change that. :)

# Thank you

Special thanks to [Darkwater](http://www.github.com/Darkwater) for inspiring me to create this.

Thanks to [Lynn](http://www.github.com/muse) for the idea of a configuration oriented script.
